### Hi, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack web developer with a background in Human Resources, E-commerce, and Product Development. I recently completed a full-time software immersive bootcamp with General Assembly, which included over 450 hrs of professional training over the course of twelve weeks. I have a passion for learning and innovation, and am excited for the opportunity to contribute my skills in a meaningful manner!


**ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning** Java through Codeacademy.

**I'm currently working on** a React.js app that has similar functionality to Goodreads.com.

**In my free time you can** find me playing videogames (currently on a Hearthstone kick), or watching a DIY tutorial on YouTube.
